# Jobs and Salaries within the Data Science Industry #

## Development of Notebook ##

The notebook was made from a For the front end of the project, the Python language was utilized to draw out the code portion for the project. The backend portion of the projet contains the CSV file founded  Within the language, a few libraries were implemented. Pandas was used to visualize the data sets. Numpy was used to manipulate the array with the data set. The plot graph was made from Matplotlib, another Python library.

Each step within the data analysis project makes up the ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load). Portions of the CSV file utilized for the project was extracted after converting the CSV file into the database and loaded into the data warehouse. This helps improve data management from revamping the dataset, and analyzing the jobs/salaries data across different sectors more efficiently.
